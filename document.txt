C:\Hugo>hugo new site test
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\test
Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Front Matters - created by dafault 
example: 
---
date: "2022-01-04T18:27:58+01:00"
title: "Home"
---


Archetypes  - has dafault.md which is defining the Front Matters in default.md file.

ShortCodes - Predfined templates of HTML
example: {{< youtube youtubeID >}}


Taxonomies - Helps us to create tags and categories - automatically generates by hugo in fetching the pages.
Examples: It displays all pages which are under same tag / category automatically by hugo.

New Taxanomy
example: moods: "happy", "sad", "upbeat"

When you add new taxnomy you have to include that in config.toml as 
[taxanomies]
	tag = "tags"
	category = "categories"
	mood = "moods"
	
Usually we dont have to include this taxanomies list in the config.toml file, but as we are creating new taxanomy called mood for that we need to create.


Template Basics:
theme >> layouts >> _default -> list.html and single.html
	
Templates: 
	>> List Page Templates
	>> Single Page Templates
